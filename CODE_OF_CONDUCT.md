# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the GOLIATH community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsible Use

GOLIATH is an AI automation tool. Users and contributors must:

- **Not** use GOLIATH to generate or distribute harmful content including hate speech, harassment, spam, phishing, or content that promotes violence or illegal activity
- **Not** use GOLIATH to automate actions that violate the terms of service of connected platforms (X/Twitter, Instagram, Discord, Telegram, Slack, GitHub, Reddit, WhatsApp, Google services, Notion)
- **Not** use GOLIATH to impersonate individuals or organizations
- **Not** use GOLIATH for mass unsolicited messaging or spam
- Comply with all applicable laws and regulations in their jurisdiction
- Respect rate limits and usage policies of all third-party APIs

GOLIATH includes a built-in content moderation layer that blocks requests involving illegal activities, hate speech, harassment, self-harm, sexual exploitation, and fraud. Attempting to circumvent these safeguards is a violation of this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including the GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other communication channels associated with the project. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers at **conduct@goliath-ai.dev**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban
